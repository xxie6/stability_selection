This is my investigation of a stability selection procedure for covariance decomposition methods.

Main takeaways thus far:  
  
* Overall, splitting the data via the columns seems to have better performance than splitting via the rows. 

All analyses:  
   
* Exploration of [stability selection in the unbalanced nonoverlapping setting](unbal_nonoverlap_setting.html) 
* Exploration of [stability selection in the balanced nonoverlapping setting](bal_nonoverlap_setting.html) 
* Exploration of [stability selection in the balanced tree setting](baltree_setting.html) 
* Exploration of [stability selection in the sparse overlapping setting](sparse_overlap_setting.html)
